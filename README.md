# My Models Portfolio <br>
Welcome to my Models Portfolio showroom :-) <br> 
Here you can find some samples of machine learning models developed by me for fun, with the purpose of creating a personal Portfolio for you to see. <br>
 Currently you can find a Regression model and a Classification model but -as I develop them- I aim to upload soon more models (including Clustering models too).  <br> <br>

The notebooks contain the entire commented process of a model development from getting the data to exporting the pipeline, in other words from zero to finish.
In particular the commented steps include:

- Data preliminary analysis for dataset comprehension
- Dataset split
- Features engineering
- Baseline model creation
- Model selection (by ranking)
- Hyperparameters tuning
- Metrics analysis
- Out of Sample metrics robstness performance test
- Conclusions and observations until here
- Pipeline creation and saving in local folder

Sincerely, Matteo
